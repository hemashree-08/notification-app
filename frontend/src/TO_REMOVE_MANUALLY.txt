Delete these files to fully remove registration:
- src/components/Register.js
- src/components/Register.css
- src/LoginRegister.js
- src/LoginRegister.css

Also remove any references to these files in your project if you find any leftovers.

Delete this file to avoid confusion and ensure only the correct login page is used:
- src/components/Login.js

Make sure App.js imports Login from './Login' and not from './components/Login'.
If you want, you can also delete this note after cleanup.
